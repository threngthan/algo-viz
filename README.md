## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the visualizer to better understand algorithm behavior.
- **Real-time Animations**: Watch algorithms in action as they process data.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports various pathfinding, searching, and sorting algorithms.
- **User-friendly Design**: A clean interface makes navigation easy for everyone.
- **Web-based**: No installation required; run it directly in your browser.

## Getting Started

To get started with Algo Viz, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/threngthan/algo-viz/releases). After downloading, extract the files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of algorithms (optional but helpful)

## Usage

Once you have the application open, you can choose from various algorithms. Each algorithm has a brief description, and you can initiate the visualization by clicking the corresponding button. 

### Steps to Use

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose from pathfinding, searching, or sorting algorithms.
2. **Input Data**: If required, input your data into the provided fields.
3. **Start Visualization**: Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
4. **Pause/Resume**: You can pause or resume the visualization at any time.
5. **Reset**: Click the reset button to start over.

## Supported Algorithms

Algo Viz currently supports the following algorithms:

### Pathfinding Algorithms

- **A* Search**: A popular algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An efficient method for finding the shortest paths in a graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds an item in a sorted array.

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer.
- **Merge Sort**: A stable sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the algorithms and interactivity.
- **D3.js**: For creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
